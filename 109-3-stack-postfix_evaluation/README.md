stack-reverse polish notation expression evaluation


### Problem Description

An arithmetic expression is given by a string array A of size N. Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each string may be an integer or an operator.

Note: Reverse Polish Notation is equivalent to Postfix Expression, where operators are written after their operands.



### Problem Constraints

```

1 <= N <= 105
```

### Example

```





Input Format
The only argument given is string array A.



Output Format
Return the value of arithmetic expression formed using reverse Polish Notation.



Example Input
Input 1:
A =   ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
Input 2:
A = ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]


Example Output
Output 1:
9
Output 2:
